# Setting Up DevStack on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) - A Beginner-Friendly Guide

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing and configuring DevStack, an OpenStack development environment, on **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS** running in **VirtualBox**. This setup includes configuring a user specifically for DevStack, setting up networking, and solving common issues such as losing access to DevStack after reboot. 

We'll assume you're running an Ubuntu VM with **4 GB RAM**, **60 GB storage**, and a **Bridge Adapter (Wifi Ethernet)** for networking.

---

## Step 1: Initial Server Setup

Start by updating your system and applying any upgrades:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
```

### Virtual Machine Setup

- **RAM:** 4 GB
- **Storage:** 60 GB
- **Network:** Bridge Adapter (WiFi Ethernet) — promiscuous mode: allow all — this connects your VM directly to your host network, allowing it to access the internet through your physical Wi-Fi.

## Step 2: Create a User for Running DevStack

To avoid running DevStack as root (which is not recommended), we will create a non-root user called `stack`. Let’s create a script for this.

### Creating the User Script

1. Switch to the root user:

    ```bash
    sudo su
    ```

2. Create a script called `create-stack-user.sh` and make it executable:

    ```bash
    sudo nano create-stack-user.sh
    sudo chmod +x create-stack-user.sh
    ```

3. Paste the following script into the file:

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # **create-stack-user.sh**
    # Create a user account for running DevStack

    set -o errexit

    # Keep track of the DevStack directory
    TOP_DIR=$(cd $(dirname "$0")/.. && pwd)

    # Import common functions
    source $TOP_DIR/functions

    # Determine the system (os_VENDOR, os_RELEASE, os_PACKAGE, etc.)
    GetDistro

    # Get the variables for user and services
    source $TOP_DIR/stackrc

    # Ensure sudo is installed
    is_package_installed sudo || install_package sudo

    [[ -z "$STACK_USER" ]] && die "STACK_USER is not set. Exiting."

    if ! getent group $STACK_USER >/dev/null; then
        echo "Creating group called $STACK_USER"
        groupadd $STACK_USER
    fi

    if ! getent passwd $STACK_USER >/dev/null; then
        echo "Creating user called $STACK_USER"
        useradd -g $STACK_USER -s /bin/bash -d $DEST -m $STACK_USER
        chmod +x $DEST
    fi

    echo "Giving stack user passwordless sudo privileges"
    grep -q "^#includedir.*/etc/sudoers.d" /etc/sudoers || echo "#includedir /etc/sudoers.d" >> /etc/sudoers
    echo "$STACK_USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/50_stack_sh
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./create-stack-user.sh
    ```

5. Switch to the new `stack` user:

    ```bash
    su stack
    ```

---

## Step 3: Clone DevStack and Configure

Now that we have the `stack` user, we can clone the DevStack repository and configure it for our system.

### Clone the DevStack Repository

1. Clone the official DevStack repository from OpenDev:

    ```bash
    git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack.git
    cd devstack
    git branch --all
    git checkout stable/2024.1
    ```

2. Copy the sample configuration file:

    ```bash
    cp samples/local.conf .
    ```

3. Edit the `local.conf` file:

    ```bash
    nano local.conf
    ```

4. Add the following configuration to `local.conf`. Replace `192.168.1.101` with your VM’s IP address (you can check it using `ifconfig` or `ip addr`):

    ```ini
    [[local|localrc]]
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin122
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
    RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
    SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
    HOST_IP=192.168.1.101
    ```

---

## Step 4: Set Up IP Forwarding and NAT for Internet Access

For DevStack instances to access the internet, we need to enable IP forwarding and set up NAT (Network Address Translation).

### Enable IP Forwarding

Run the following command to enable IP forwarding:

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

### Set Up NAT with IPTables

Configure the NAT settings for the network adapter:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE
```

- Replace `enp0s3` with your network adapter, which you can find by running `ifconfig` or `ip addr`.

---

## Step 5: Launch DevStack

Now, it’s time to launch DevStack. Run the main stack script:

```bash
./stack.sh
```

This will take some time as it downloads and installs various OpenStack components. Once it’s complete, you will have a fully functioning OpenStack environment.

You can access the OpenStack dashboard by navigating to:

```
http://192.168.1.101/dashboard
```

Use the username `admin` and the password `admin122` (or the password you set in `local.conf`).

---

## Step 6: Networking Configuration for External Access

To allow instances to have external network access, we need to configure an external network.

1. When prompted to create a network, choose **Flat**.
2. Set **"public"** as the Physical Network.

---

## Step 7: Resolving Common Issues

### Issue 1: Losing DevStack After Reboot

If you shut down your Ubuntu VM, DevStack will stop working because the external bridge (`br-ex`) will lose its IP. Here’s how to fix it.

#### Solution:

Manually re-add the IP address after reboot:

```bash
ip addr add 172.24.4.1/24 dev br-ex
ip link set br-ex up
```

You can also make this change permanent by modifying the `/etc/netplan/` configuration.

### Issue 2: Instances Cannot Access the Internet

If your DevStack instances can’t access the internet, update the DNS configuration.

1. Open the system resolver configuration file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
    ```

2. Add Google's public DNS servers:

    ```bash
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    ```

---

## Step 8: Clean Up and Restart DevStack

If you need to stop or clean up your DevStack environment:

1. To stop DevStack:

    ```bash
    ./unstack.sh
    ```

2. To clean up DevStack completely:

    ```bash
    ./clean.sh
    ```

---

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully installed and configured DevStack on **Ubuntu 22.04.5** running in VirtualBox. With this setup, you can explore and develop in an OpenStack environment on your local machine. Remember, DevStack is intended for development and testing, not for production environments.

Happy stacking!
