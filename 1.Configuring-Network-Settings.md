# Beginner's Guide to Configuring Network Settings, Hostname, and SSH Access on Ubuntu

In this guide, we will go through configuring a static IP address using Netplan, setting a hostname, updating your hosts file, and enabling passwordless SSH login using SSH keys. These steps are crucial for setting up your Ubuntu machine for networking and remote access in a local environment like a home lab.

## 1. Configuring Static IP Address with Netplan

Ubuntu uses Netplan for managing network configurations. By default, most systems use DHCP to assign an IP address, but if you need a static IP (e.g., in a home lab), you can modify the Netplan configuration file.

### Step 1: Edit the Netplan Configuration File

1. Open the Netplan configuration file using `nano`, a simple text editor:
   
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
   ```

2. You’ll see an existing configuration. We will modify it to set a static IP. Replace the existing configuration with the following settings:

   ```yaml
   network:
       version: 2
       ethernets:
           enp0s3:
               dhcp4: no  # Disable DHCP for IPv4
               dhcp6: no  # Disable DHCP for IPv6
               addresses:
                   - 192.168.2.88/24  # Set your static IP address
               gateway4: 192.168.2.1  # Define the gateway (your router's IP)
               nameservers:
                   addresses:
                       - 1.1.1.1  # Cloudflare DNS server
                       - 1.0.0.1  # Cloudflare DNS secondary server
   ```

   Here’s a breakdown of the key parts:
   - `enp0s3`: This is the network interface name. Your interface may differ (e.g., `eth0` or `ens33`). Check using `ip a`.
   - `addresses`: This is the static IP address you want to assign to your machine.
   - `gateway4`: This is the IP of your router or gateway.
   - `nameservers`: These are the DNS servers for resolving domain names. We're using Cloudflare's DNS in this example.

### Step 2: Apply the Netplan Configuration

After saving the file, apply the new configuration with the following command:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

At this point, your machine should have the static IP address `192.168.2.88`.

## 2. Setting the Hostname

The hostname is the name of your computer on the network. It's useful for identification and makes accessing your machine easier.

### Step 1: Set the Hostname

1. Switch to root user to ensure you have the necessary permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo su
   ```

2. Change the hostname to something meaningful, like `homelab-compute01`:

   ```bash
   hostname homelab-compute01
   ```

3. Permanently update the hostname file:

   ```bash
   echo 'homelab-compute01' > /etc/hostname
   ```

### Step 2: Update the `/etc/hosts` File

The `/etc/hosts` file maps IP addresses to hostnames. Let's add an entry for the new hostname.

1. Open the hosts file using `nano`:

   ```bash
   nano /etc/hosts
   ```

2. Add the following line to the file:

   ```bash
   192.168.1.111 homelab-compute01
   ```

3. Save and close the file.

### Step 3: Test the Hostname Resolution

To ensure everything is working correctly, ping your machine by its hostname:

```bash
ping -c 4 homelab-compute01
```

If the configuration is correct, you should see a successful ping response from your machine.

## 3. Setting Up SSH Key Authentication

Using SSH keys allows you to securely log into your machine without needing to enter a password every time. This is helpful for administrators and home lab setups.

### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key Pair

Switch to the user you want to generate the SSH key for:

```bash
su - admin01
```

Now generate the SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

You'll be prompted to choose a location to save the key. Press **Enter** to save it to the default path (`/home/admin01/.ssh/id_rsa`).

Next, you will be asked to set a passphrase. You can leave it blank for automatic login, but for added security, you might consider setting a passphrase.

### Step 2: Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server

After generating the key, you need to copy the public key to the remote server. Assuming you're still on the local machine, run:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub admin01@homelab-compute01
```

You’ll be prompted to enter the password for `admin01` on `homelab-compute01`. After that, the public key will be copied over, enabling key-based SSH login.

### Step 3: Test SSH Key Authentication

Now, test the key-based login by connecting to the server:

```bash
ssh admin01@homelab-compute01
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should log in without needing to enter the password!
