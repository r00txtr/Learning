Here are some practical tasks for a DevOps engineer job vacancy, focusing on essential skills and tools used in DevOps practices. These tasks aim to assess the candidate's knowledge and experience with CI/CD pipelines, automation, cloud services, containerization, and infrastructure management.

### Task 1: **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
- **Objective**: Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
- **Requirements**:
  1. Create a Git repository (on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) containing a sample application (you can choose any stack like Node.js, Python, or Java).
  2. Implement the pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy the application on a staging server.
  3. Automate testing (unit tests) and include a step for code linting.
  4. Deploy the application using an automated tool like Ansible, Terraform, or Docker.

- **Deliverables**:
  1. Pipeline configuration file (e.g., `Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows`).
  2. Documentation explaining the pipeline setup and how to run it.

### Task 2: **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform**
- **Objective**: Provision infrastructure using Terraform.
- **Requirements**:
  1. Write a Terraform configuration to deploy an EC2 instance on AWS (or VM on GCP/Azure).
  2. The instance should have NGINX installed and running.
  3. Set up security groups to allow access to HTTP (port 80).
  4. Include best practices such as version control and state management (e.g., use of `terraform.tfstate` file remotely).

- **Deliverables**:
  1. Terraform configuration files (`.tf` files).
  2. Instructions on how to deploy and destroy the infrastructure.

### Task 3: **Containerization with Docker**
- **Objective**: Containerize a simple application and set up orchestration using Kubernetes.
- **Requirements**:
  1. Create a Dockerfile for the application (can use a sample web app).
  2. Write a Kubernetes YAML configuration file to deploy the containerized application.
  3. Ensure the deployment is scalable with multiple replicas.
  4. Implement a LoadBalancer service to expose the application.

- **Deliverables**:
  1. Dockerfile.
  2. Kubernetes configuration (YAML) files.
  3. Instructions on how to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster (can use Minikube for testing).

### Task 4: **Monitoring and Logging Setup**
- **Objective**: Set up monitoring and logging for an application.
- **Requirements**:
  1. Use a tool like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application performance (e.g., CPU, memory usage).
  2. Implement log aggregation using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki and Promtail.
  3. Configure alerting for when the application exceeds a defined CPU or memory threshold.

- **Deliverables**:
  1. Configuration files for Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK/Loki.
  2. Screenshots showing the monitoring dashboards and sample alerts.
  3. Documentation on how to replicate the setup.

### Task 5: **Automation with Ansible**
- **Objective**: Automate the deployment of a web application.
- **Requirements**:
  1. Write an Ansible playbook to install Apache/Nginx and deploy a simple web application on a remote server.
  2. Ensure idempotency in your playbook (i.e., re-running it should not change the system unless required).
  3. Use Ansible roles for better modularization of tasks.

- **Deliverables**:
  1. Ansible playbook and role structure.
  2. Instructions on how to run the playbook on a remote server.

These tasks will help evaluate the candidate's proficiency in various DevOps tools and methodologies, as well as their ability to work with automation, CI/CD, infrastructure management, and monitoring tools.

Here are three additional tasks to further evaluate a candidate's DevOps engineering skills, with a focus on advanced cloud and automation practices, security, and scalability.

### Task 6: **AWS Lambda Function for Automation**
- **Objective**: Implement a serverless function using AWS Lambda to automate a task.
- **Requirements**:
  1. Create a Lambda function that triggers based on an S3 event (e.g., when a new file is uploaded to a specific S3 bucket).
  2. The Lambda function should process the file (e.g., compress it or convert its format) and save the output back to another S3 bucket.
  3. Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to provision the Lambda function and necessary resources (S3 buckets, IAM roles, etc.).

- **Deliverables**:
  1. Lambda function code.
  2. CloudFormation or Terraform templates.
  3. Documentation explaining how to set up and test the automation.

### Task 7: **Load Testing and Auto-Scaling**
- **Objective**: Set up auto-scaling in response to load on an application hosted in a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
- **Requirements**:
  1. Deploy a sample web application on AWS EC2 (or GCP/Azure equivalent).
  2. Configure a load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
  3. Set up auto-scaling rules to automatically add or remove instances based on CPU usage thresholds.
  4. Use a tool like Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate load and trigger auto-scaling.
  
- **Deliverables**:
  1. Terraform or CloudFormation configuration for setting up auto-scaling.
  2. Results from the load test showing the system's scalability.
  3. Screenshots or logs showing the instances scaling in and out.

### Task 8: **Security Best Practices Implementation**
- **Objective**: Harden an application environment by implementing security best practices.
- **Requirements**:
  1. Secure an application hosted on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EC2 instance) by configuring firewalls, security groups, and IAM roles.
  2. Implement SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS using Let's Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager.
  3. Use a tool like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to manage and securely store environment variables and secrets.
  4. Conduct a vulnerability scan using a tool like OWASP ZAP or SonarQube, and address the critical findings.

- **Deliverables**:
  1. Security configuration details (firewalls, security groups, IAM roles).
  2. Details on SSL/TLS setup (e.g., certificate files or Cloud configuration).
  3. Vulnerability scan results and the steps taken to mitigate any critical issues.
