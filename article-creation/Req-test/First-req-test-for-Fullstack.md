A detailed requirement test for a Fullstack Engineer vacancy should assess both front-end and back-end development skills, as well as their ability to integrate the two. It should also evaluate their understanding of databases, APIs, deployment strategies, and version control. Additionally, soft skills such as problem-solving, collaboration, and adaptability to new technologies should be assessed.

Here’s a structured and detailed requirement test for a Fullstack Engineer vacancy:

- **Describe the differences** between client-side and server-side rendering.
- **Explain the concept of RESTful APIs** and how they are used in fullstack development.
- **What are the most important considerations** when designing an application that involves both a front-end and back-end?

### **Assessment:** This section should gauge the candidate’s general knowledge about fullstack development, design patterns, and best practices.

- **React/Angular/Vue.js Task (choose one):** Develop a simple single-page application (SPA) that displays a list of users fetched from an API and allows the user to filter by name and sort by age.

### **Sample Questions:**
- **Explain the virtual DOM** and its role in frameworks like React.
- **What are the advantages of using CSS preprocessors** like SASS or LESS? Provide examples of how they simplify the CSS workflow.
- **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript** (e.g., promises, async/await)? Provide an example.

### **Assessment:** Candidates should demonstrate their ability to write clean, responsive front-end code, work with frameworks, and understand modern JavaScript concepts like async operations and DOM manipulation.

This section assesses back-end development skills, including server-side programming languages, databases, and API creation.

### **Tasks/Questions:**
- **API Task (Node.js/Python/Java):** Create a RESTful API that supports basic CRUD operations for a "user" resource. The API should allow creating, reading, updating, and deleting users from a database (use any database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).
- **Authentication Task:** Implement user authentication (register/login) using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The API should include protected routes that require authentication.
- **Database Task:** Set up a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) or a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and write a query to join two tables (for relational DBs) or aggregate data (for NoSQL).

### **Sample Questions:**
- **Explain the difference** between SQL and NoSQL databases. When would you choose one over the other?
- **Describe how you handle error handling** in a back-end application.
- **Explain the purpose of middleware** in frameworks like Express.js (for Node.js) or Django (for Python).

### **Assessment:** This section should evaluate the candidate's ability to handle server-side logic, manage databases, build APIs, and implement security measures.

---

## **4. Database Management (SQL & NoSQL)**
Understanding and working with databases, both relational and non-relational, is a crucial skill for a fullstack engineer. This section should focus on testing their knowledge of databases, how to interact with them, and optimize them for performance.

### **Tasks/Questions:**
- **Database Query Task (SQL):** Write a query to fetch data from multiple tables (using JOINs) and filter the result based on a specific condition (e.g., users who have placed an order in the last 30 days).
- **Database Schema Task:** Design a database schema for a blogging platform where users can create posts, comment on posts, and like posts. Explain your design choices.
- **NoSQL Task:** For a document database (e.g., MongoDB), design a schema to store data for an e-commerce website where products, categories, and users are stored. Ensure the schema is optimized for performance.

### **Sample Questions:**
- **What is database normalization**? Explain the concept and its importance in relational database design.
- **Explain the difference between ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) theorem.
- **Describe indexing** in databases and how it affects performance.

### **Assessment:** Evaluate the candidate's ability to design database schemas, write efficient queries, and optimize database performance.

---

## **5. API Development and Integration**
This section should evaluate the candidate’s ability to build, consume, and secure APIs.

### **Tasks/Questions:**
- **API Design Task:** Design an API for a social media application that allows users to post status updates, like updates, and comment on updates. Define the API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanism.
- **API Integration Task:** Write a function that consumes a third-party API (e.g., GitHub API) and displays the results on a web page.
- **Security Task:** Explain how you would secure an API to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

### **Assessment:** Test the candidate’s knowledge of RESTful API design principles, API security, and ability to integrate third-party services.

## **6. Version Control (Git/GitHub/GitLab)**
Version control is a fundamental skill for fullstack engineers. This section should test the candidate's familiarity with Git and collaboration workflows.

### **Tasks/Questions:**
- **Git Task:** Given a feature branch, resolve a merge conflict and commit the resolved changes. Show how you would handle the process.
- **Git Workflow Task:** Describe the branching strategy you would use in a project with multiple developers (e.g., Gitflow, Feature Branching, Trunk-Based Development).
- **Explain the difference between rebasing and merging** in Git. When would you use one over the other?

### **Assessment:** This section assesses the candidate’s ability to use Git for version control, resolve conflicts, and follow collaboration best practices.

---

## **7. Testing (Unit, Integration, End-to-End)**
A good fullstack engineer should understand how to write tests to ensure the reliability of both front-end and back-end components.

### **Tasks/Questions:**
