## **3. Foundational Skills** (1-2 Months)  

### 1. **Linux/Unix Fundamentals:**  
- Learn **basic Linux commands** (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `chmod`) as most DevOps tools run on Linux systems.  
- Set up a virtual machine (VM) or use cloud platforms to practice.  
- Suggested Resources:  
  - [Linux Survival Guide](https://linuxsurvival.com/)  
  - FreeCodeCamp’s YouTube tutorials  

### 2. **Networking Basics:**  
Understand **IP addressing, DNS, HTTP, firewalls, and load balancers**. This knowledge will help you troubleshoot infrastructure issues effectively.

### 3. **Version Control (Git):**  
Git is a must-know tool for tracking code changes and collaborating with developers.  
- Learn Git basics: `clone`, `commit`, `branch`, `push`, `merge`.  
- Hands-on: Create a GitHub account and host a personal project.  
- Resource: [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)

### 4. **Programming and Scripting:**  
Familiarity with a programming or scripting language is essential.  
- **Bash:** For scripting and automation on Unix systems.  
- **Python:** For building tools, automation, and interacting with APIs.  
- Suggested Course: Codecademy’s **Learn Python**.

## **4. DevOps Tools and Practices** (3-4 Months)  

### 1. **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD):**  
- **Jenkins:** Automate builds and tests.  
- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI:** Automate workflows directly from repositories.  
- **Practice:** Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline to automate code testing and deployment.  

### 2. **Containerization and Orchestration:**  
- **Docker:** Learn how to containerize applications to ensure consistency across environments.  
  - Practice: Deploy a simple Node.js app using Docker.  
- **Kubernetes:** Manage containers in production, ensuring **scalability** and **high availability**.  
  - Practice: Deploy your Docker container to a Kubernetes cluster using **Minikube** or **K3D**.  

### 3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  
- **Terraform:** Automate infrastructure setup using code.  
- **Ansible:** Manage configuration files and automate system tasks.  
  - Practice: Write a Terraform script to deploy a virtual machine in AWS.

---

## **5. Practical Projects and Certifications** (Ongoing)  

### **Project Ideas:**  
- **Set up a CI/CD pipeline:** Use Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate builds and tests.  
- **Container Deployment:** Containerize a web app using Docker and deploy it on Kubernetes.  
- **IaC Practice:** Use Terraform to provision cloud infrastructure on AWS or Azure.  

### **Certifications to Consider:**  
- **AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional**  
- **Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert**  
- **Docker Certified Associate**  
Certifications validate your skills and can make you stand out in the job market.

## **6. Monitoring and Logging** (2-3 Months)  

Monitoring helps ensure applications are performing well and are free from issues.  

- **Prometheus & Grafana:** Collect metrics and visualize system health.  
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** Centralized logging and troubleshooting.  
- **Practice:** Set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor a web server.

---

## **7. Soft Skills and Continuous Learning**  

Being a DevOps engineer isn't just about technical expertise—you also need **soft skills** and the ability to adapt to evolving technologies.  

### **Key Soft Skills:**  
- **Collaboration:** Work closely with development, operations, and QA teams.  
- **Communication:** Clearly explain technical issues and processes to non-technical stakeholders.  
- **Problem-Solving:** Quickly identify and fix infrastructure or software problems.

### **Continuous Learning:**
