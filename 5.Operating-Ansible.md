# Operating Ansible with Ad-hoc Commands, Configuration Files, Playbooks, Variables, and Jinja2 Templates

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies IT tasks such as configuration management, software deployment, and infrastructure orchestration. This article walks you through various key features of Ansible, including using ad-hoc commands, managing configuration files, writing playbooks, handling variables, and working with Jinja2 templates.

## A. Operating Ansible with Ad-hoc Commands

Ad-hoc commands are simple, one-off commands that Ansible executes without writing a full playbook. They're useful for quick tasks like checking system information or copying files.

### 1. Checking Hostnames
You can use Ansible ad-hoc commands to get the hostname of all your managed nodes:
```bash
ansible all -m command -a "hostname"
```
This command runs the `hostname` command on all nodes defined in your inventory file.

### 2. Gathering System Information
Ansibleâ€™s `setup` module gathers system information from a node:
```bash
ansible pod-managed1 -m setup
```
This command displays detailed facts about the managed node `pod-managed1`.

### 3. Checking User Information
You can also run commands on the localhost to check user information:
```bash
ansible localhost -m command -a 'id'
ansible localhost -u student -m command -a 'id'
```

### 4. Copying Files and Verifying the Operation
Ansible allows you to copy files to remote hosts using the `copy` module:
```bash
ansible localhost --become -u student -m copy -a "content='Executed by Ansible\n' dest=/etc/motd"
```
This command writes "Executed by Ansible" to the `/etc/motd` file. You can verify it by reading the file:
```bash
ansible localhost -u student -m command -a 'cat /etc/motd'
```

## B. Managing Ansible Configuration Files

### 1. Creating and Configuring the Ansible Environment

Start by creating a directory for your Ansible project:
```bash
cd ~/
mkdir -p deploy-review
cd deploy-review
```

### 2. Editing the `ansible.cfg` File
Create an `ansible.cfg` file to define inventory location and other configuration parameters:
```bash
vi ansible.cfg
```
Example configuration:
```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = admin01
host_key_checking = False
```

### 3. Defining the Inventory
The inventory file defines the hosts that Ansible will manage:
```bash
vi inventory
```
Example inventory:
```ini
[servers]
pod-managed1
```

### 4. Running Ad-hoc Commands
You can now run ad-hoc commands like checking the user ID on all servers:
```bash
ansible all -m command -a 'id'
```
Or copying a message to the `motd` file:
```bash
ansible all -m copy -a "content='This server is managed by Ansible. \n' dest=/etc/motd" --become
```

---

## C. Writing Ansible Playbooks

Playbooks are YAML files that define a series of tasks for Ansible to run.

### 1. Setting Up the Playbook Environment
Start by creating the necessary directory and files:
```bash
cd ~/
mkdir -p playbook-basic/files
cd playbook-basic
```

### 2. Configuring the Playbook

Create an `ansible.cfg` file:
```bash
nano ansible.cfg
```
Example configuration:
```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = admin01
```

Create an inventory file:
```bash
nano inventory
```
Example:
```ini
[web]
pod-managed1
```

Create an `index.html` file:
```bash
echo "This is a test page." > files/index.html
```

### 3. Writing the Playbook
Now, create the playbook that installs Apache and copies the `index.html` file:
```bash
nano site.yml
```
Playbook content:
```yaml
- name: Install and start Apache 2.
  hosts: pod-managed1
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: apache2 package is present
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        force_apt_get: yes
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: correct index.html is present
      copy:
        src: files/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html

    - name: Apache 2 is started
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

### 4. Running the Playbook
Execute the playbook using the following command:
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -K
```

You can verify that the web server is running by using `curl`:
```bash
curl pod-managed1
```

## D. Managing Ansible Variables

Variables in Ansible make your playbooks more flexible and reusable.

### 1. Setting Up the Variables Environment
Create a new directory and configuration:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir data-variables/
cd data-variables/
```
Create the `ansible.cfg` file:
```bash
vi ansible.cfg
```
Example:
```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = admin01
host_key_checking = False
```

Define your inventory:
```bash
vi inventory
```
Example:
```ini
[webserver]
pod-managed1
```

### 2. Writing a Playbook with Variables
Create a playbook file:
```bash
vi playbook.yml
```
Example playbook using variables:
```yaml
- name: Deploy and start Apache 2 service
  hosts: webserver
  become: true
  vars:
    web_pkg: apache2
    web_service: apache2
  tasks:
    - name: Required packages are installed and up to date
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        name:
          - "{{web_pkg}}"
        state: latest
    - name: The {{web_service}} service is started and enabled
      service:
         name: "{{web_service}}"
         enabled: true
         state: started
    - name: Web content is in place
      copy:
        content: "Example web content"
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
```

Run the playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

---

## E. Managing Jinja2 Templates

Ansible uses Jinja2 templates to generate dynamic files during playbook execution.

### 1. Setting Up the Template Directory
Create a new directory:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir jinja2-template
cd jinja2-template
```

### 2. Defining the Inventory and Playbook
Create the inventory file:
```bash
vi inventory
```
Example:
```ini
[webservers]
pod-managed1
```

Create the playbook file:
```bash
vi site.yml
```
Example:
```yaml
- name: Install and start apache2
  hosts: pod-managed1
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: apache2 package is present
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
        force_apt_get: yes

    - name: restart apache2 service
      service: name=apache2 state=restarted enabled=yes

    - name: copy index.html
      template: src=admin01.html.j2 dest=/var/www/html/admin01.html
```

### 3. Writing the Jinja2 Template
Create the Jinja2 template:
```bash
vi admin01.html.j2
```
Example:
```
Hello World!
This is <username> site.
```

### 4. Running the Playbook
Run the playbook to deploy the Jinja2 template:
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

Verify the output using `curl`:
```bash
curl pod-managed1/admin01.html
```

## F. Quiz 1: Automating Docker Deployment

### Task:
1. Create a folder `quiz1` in the home directory.
2. Write a playbook that:
   - Adds the Docker repository using a Jinja2 template.
   - Installs `docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin docker-compose`.
   - Starts and enables the `docker` service.

### Solution:

Create the directory:
```bash
mkdir ~/quiz1
cd ~/quiz1
```

Create the repository template file:
```bash
vi docker.list.j2
```
Content:
```
deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu {{ ansible_lsb.codename }} stable
```

Create the playbook file:
```bash
vi service-docker.yml
```
Playbook content:
```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Add Docker GPG key
      apt_key:
        url: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg
        state: present

    - name: Add Docker repository
      template:
        src: docker.list.j2
        dest: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

    - name: Update apt repository
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install Docker and plugins
      apt:
        name:
          - docker-ce
          - docker-ce-cli
          - containerd.io
          - docker-buildx-plugin
          - docker-compose-plugin
          - docker-compose
        state: present

    - name: Set permissions on Docker socket
      command: sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock

    - name: Add user to Docker group
      user:
        name: admin01
        group: docker
        append: yes

    - name: Start and enable Docker service
      service:
        name: docker
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Pull Nginx image
      community.docker.docker_image:
        name: nginx
        tag: latest
        source: pull

    - name: Create and run Nginx container
      docker_container:
        name: my_nginx
        image: nginx
        state: started
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
```

Run the playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook service-docker.yml -K -vvvv
```

Verify the output using `curl`:
```bash
curl pod-managed1:8080
```
