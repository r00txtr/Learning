# Installing and Configuring MicroStack on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing and configuring **MicroStack** (a lightweight version of OpenStack) on **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS** running in **VirtualBox**. This tutorial will also include troubleshooting common issues like instances failing to connect to the internet, configuring port forwarding, and how to remove MicroStack if needed.

### Requirements:
- **RAM:** 4 GB
- **Storage:** 60 GB
- **Network:** Bridge Adapter (WiFi Ethernet) — promiscuous mode: allow all — connects your VM to your local network, enabling internet access.

## Step 1: Initial System Update

Start by updating your Ubuntu system to ensure all packages are up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
```

---

## Step 2: Installing MicroStack

MicroStack can be installed via **Snap**, which makes it straightforward to deploy OpenStack components. Let’s get started:

1. Install MicroStack from the beta channel:

    ```bash
    sudo snap install microstack --beta
    ```

    This command installs the MicroStack snap package.

2. Initialize MicroStack in control mode:

    ```bash
    sudo microstack init --auto --control
    ```

    This sets up the MicroStack environment, enabling the control plane and setting up the necessary configurations automatically.

3. Retrieve the Keystone password for authentication:

    ```bash
    sudo snap get microstack config.credentials.keystone-password
    ```

    You’ll need this password to log in to the OpenStack dashboard and interact with OpenStack services.

## Step 3: Troubleshooting Instance Connectivity

If you create instances but they can't connect to the internet, follow these steps to resolve the issue.

### a. Check Security Group Rules

Ensure that your instance’s security group allows outgoing traffic to the internet. You can modify security group rules via the OpenStack dashboard:

1. Go to the **Security Groups** section.
2. Add a rule to allow **ICMP** for pings and **TCP** for HTTP/HTTPS.

### b. Enable IP Forwarding on Ubuntu

For instances to reach the internet, IP forwarding must be enabled. To do this:

```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

This command enables IPv4 forwarding on your Ubuntu system.

### c. Configure NAT (Network Address Translation)

If enabling IP forwarding doesn’t resolve the issue, you can create a **POSTROUTING** rule in **iptables** to ensure proper traffic routing:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.20.20.1/24 ! -d 10.20.20.1/24 -j MASQUERADE
```

- **10.20.20.1/24** is the subnet used by your instances. Replace this with the subnet configured in your OpenStack network.
- **MASQUERADE** allows the traffic to be rewritten so it can access the internet.

### d. External Networking Configuration

To provide external access for instances, ensure you configure the external network as **Flat** and set the **Physical Network** to **physnet1**.

---

## Step 4: MicroStack Command Aliases

Managing MicroStack can be simplified by creating an alias for `openstack` commands:

```bash
sudo snap alias microstack.openstack openstack
```

This allows you to use the standard `openstack` CLI commands without typing `microstack.openstack` every time.

---

## Step 5: Using TLS with MicroStack

To enable **TLS** (SSL) for secure communications in MicroStack, you need to add the path to the **Certificate Authority (CA)** certificate in your environment configuration.

1. Edit the `admin-openrc.sh` file:

    ```bash
    nano /var/snap/microstack/common/etc/admin-openrc.sh
    ```

2. Add the following line to include the path to the CA certificate:

    ```bash
    export OS_CACERT=/var/snap/microstack/common/etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem
    ```

3. Save and exit the file.

This ensures that the OpenStack client will use the proper TLS certificates when communicating with the MicroStack services.

---

## Step 6: Removing and Cleaning Up MicroStack

If you no longer need MicroStack and want to remove it from your system, you can follow these steps to completely uninstall and clean up the installation.

### a. Stop and Remove MicroStack

1. To stop the running services:

    ```bash
    sudo snap stop microstack
    ```

2. To remove MicroStack:

    ```bash
    sudo snap remove microstack
    ```

### b. Clean Up Leftover Files and Configuration

Removing the snap package doesn’t remove all configuration files. You can manually remove the remaining files to ensure a clean system:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/snap/microstack
```

This removes all data, logs, and configuration files related to MicroStack.

## Conclusion

You’ve now successfully installed and configured **MicroStack** on **Ubuntu 22.04.5**. This lightweight OpenStack version is ideal for development and testing. We've also covered how to troubleshoot common issues such as instances not connecting to the internet and how to safely remove MicroStack if you need to clean up your environment.

Happy experimenting with OpenStack!
