# Beginner's Guide: Installing SSL on Ubuntu Server with Nginx and Apache

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through how to install SSL certificates on your Ubuntu server with a private IP address using Nginx and Apache. This will enable HTTPS for secure communication on your server. We will cover two parts:

1. SSL Installation with Nginx.
2. SSL Installation with Apache.

### 1. **SSL Installation on Ubuntu Server with Nginx**

#### Step 1: Update Your Server and Install Nginx & OpenSSL

Before you begin, update your Ubuntu server and install the necessary packages (Nginx and OpenSSL):

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y nginx openssl
```

#### Step 2: Create SSL Configuration Files

1. Create a directory to store your SSL files and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir SSL && cd SSL/
   ```

2. Now, create a configuration file for generating SSL certificates:

   ```bash
   sudo nano localhost.conf
   ```

3. Add the following content to the `localhost.conf` file. This defines the SSL certificate settings:

   ```ini
   [req]
   default_bits       = 2048
   default_keyfile    = localhost.key
   distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
   req_extensions     = req_ext
   x509_extensions    = v3_ca

   [req_distinguished_name]
   countryName                 = Country Name (2 letter code)
   countryName_default         = ID
   stateOrProvinceName         = State or Province Name (full name)
   stateOrProvinceName_default = DKI Jakarta
   localityName                = Locality Name (eg, city)
   localityName_default        = Jakarta
   organizationName            = Organization Name (eg, company)
   organizationName_default    = ServerDEV
   organizationalUnitName      = organizationalunit
   organizationalUnitName_default = Telkom-Dev
   commonName                  = Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name)
   commonName_default          = Server-DEV
   commonName_max              = 64

   [req_ext]
   subjectAltName = @alt_names

   [v3_ca]
   subjectAltName = @alt_names

   [alt_names]
   DNS.1   = localhost
   IP.1    = 192.168.1.9
   ```

   - **Common Name (CN)** is used to specify the domain or server name. In this example, we use `Server-DEV` as the common name and `192.168.1.9` as the private IP address.

#### Step 3: Generate SSL Certificates

Run the following command to generate the SSL certificate and key:

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -config localhost.conf
```

This will generate two files:
- `localhost.key` (the private key)
- `localhost.crt` (the certificate)

Move them to the appropriate directories for Nginx:

```bash
sudo cp localhost.crt /etc/ssl/certs/localhost.crt
sudo cp localhost.key /etc/ssl/private/localhost.key
```

#### Step 4: Configure Nginx for SSL

Edit the Nginx default configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Modify it to include SSL settings as shown below:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name localhost;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/localhost.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/localhost.key;
    
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1 TLSv1;

    root /var/www/html;

    index index.html index.nginx-debian.html;
}

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    server_name _;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

- This configuration ensures that all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.

#### Step 5: Apply the Configuration

Finally, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo service nginx reload
```

Now, you can access your site via HTTPS using your server's local IP:

```
https://192.168.1.9
```

### 2. **SSL Installation on Ubuntu Server with Apache**

If you're using Apache instead of Nginx, the process for setting up SSL is slightly different.

#### Step 1: Update Your Server and Install Apache & OpenSSL

Start by updating your system and installing the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y apache2 openssl
```

#### Step 2: Generate SSL Certificates for Apache

1. Use OpenSSL to create an SSL certificate and key for Apache:

   ```bash
   sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
   ```

   This command generates the following files:
   - `/etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key` (the private key)
   - `/etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt` (the certificate)

#### Step 3: Configure Apache for SSL

Next, enable SSL in Apache and set up the virtual host file to use your new certificate.

1. Enable the SSL module in Apache:

   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod ssl
   ```

2. Edit the default SSL virtual host configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
   ```

3. Update the SSL certificate paths:

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:443>
       ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
       ServerName localhost

       DocumentRoot /var/www/html

       SSLEngine on
       SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
       SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key

       <FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
           SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
       </FilesMatch>

       <Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>
           SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
       </Directory>

       BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
               nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
               downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

#### Step 4: Enable SSL Site and Restart Apache

Enable the SSL site in Apache and restart the service:

```bash
sudo a2ensite default-ssl
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

#### Step 5: Access Your Site with HTTPS

Now, your Apache server is set up with SSL. You can access the site securely using the private IP:

```
https://192.168.1.9
```

### Conclusion

Setting up SSL on your Ubuntu server with Nginx or Apache ensures secure communication between your server and clients. While this guide used a private IP, the same steps apply to public IPs and domain names. By following these simple steps, you can protect your server with HTTPS.

For a better user experience, make sure to replace the private IP with your server's public IP or domain if you intend to make it accessible from the internet.
